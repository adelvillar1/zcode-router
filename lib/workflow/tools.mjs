 * The workspace tools a workflow's agents may use, and the journal that records
 * what they did.
 *
 * The tool set is deliberately narrow and read-mostly: agents read files,
 * search, run an allowlisted command, and write inside the workspace. ZCode's
 * runtime gives its actors the harness's full tools; this kit gives them a fixed
 * surface with fixed argv (no shell anywhere) so a workflow run can never
 * express a command the run log cannot show. Writing matters — coverage-push's
 * test writers and migration's migrators have to change files to do their job —
 * so `write_file` exists, scoped to the workspace the operator chose.
