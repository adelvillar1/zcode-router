/**
 * The harnessed agent control plane's assembly module.
 *
 * An agent in a workflow run gets no harness: no CLAUDE.md, no shell history,
 * no installed-tooling knowledge, no notion of what it owns. Everything a real
 * harness would have handed it is assembled here, from measured facts and
 * declared contracts:
 *
 *   - measureEnvironment() probes the workspace through the run's own command
 *     allowlist — versions are measured at dispatch time, never assumed;
 *   - renderBrief() renders the run-level harness block (environment, pinned
 *     stack, layout, verification recipe, completeness clause);
 *   - renderContract() renders the per-part contract (owned files, isolation
 *     rule, acceptance criteria, exposed interface) — the block the engine
 *     appends to every ask an agent with a contract makes.
 *
 * Both consumers route through this module: the engine's
 * `agent(name, { system, contract })` and every workflow's brief blocks. A
 * brief assembled anywhere else is the duplication this module exists to end.
 *
 * The judgment path composes dev-decisions first (`dev-decisions judge` — same
 * heads, same rows in the shared calibration store) with raw sys1 as the
 * recorded fallback; see makeJudgingClassifier.

//      is refused by name rather than absorbed as prose.

 * than discarding its siblings — a parallel set is a failure domain, and the
 * plane's job is to keep one member's failure from being the run's.
 *
 * `members` is `[{ name, run }]`, where `run` returns the member's result. The
 * result is never shaped here: what a survivor is belongs to whoever declared
 * the set. `minimum` is how many survivors make the set usable — 2 for a
 * competition, which needs something to compare, 1 for a parallel build, where
 * one part is all a champion needs to carry on integrating.
 *
 * The verdict arrives three ways over the same runs: `survivors` and `failures`
