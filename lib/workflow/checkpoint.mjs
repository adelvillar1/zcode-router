/**
 * Per-part checkpoints: the workspace isolation the swarm never had.
 *
 * Parts write straight into the workspace, so a part that fails mid-build
 * leaves debris behind and the champion integrates it. A checkpoint closes
 * that: taken before a part runs, it holds every path the part's contract
 * declared along with the bytes that were there, and a rollback restores
 * exactly those paths — after it, a failed part's tree is indistinguishable
 * from the workspace that existed before the part ran.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow: a checkpoint covers the declared paths and
 * nothing else. The parts of one champion build concurrently into one
 * namespace, so a wider snapshot (the whole namespace) would restore over a
 * sibling's work — the exclusive ownership `validateContract` enforces is the
 * same ownership this relies on. A path no part declared is not this part's to
 * delete, so what a rollback could not clean is reported rather than removed:
 * the journal line names what survived, so debris is visible instead of
 * invisible.
 *
 * A checkpoint is a value, not a handle: nothing to leak, nothing to stop at
 * run-done, and the plane's failure path is the only thing that ever restores
 * one. These hold no grant decisions either — the paths come from a contract
 * the dispatch gate already validated, and an escaping path is refused here
 * because a rollback would otherwise write outside the workspace.
