/**
 * The workflow runtime engine.
 *
 * A workflow is a TypeScript file under `workflows/` that uses the documented
 * surface (docs/features/workflow-runtime.md): `agent(...).ask<T>()`, `phase`,
 * `log`, `report`, `artifact.*`, `files.*`, `git.*`, `world.run`, `args`.
 * This module loads that file, binds the surface as globals, runs it, and
 * journals everything it did.
 *
 * Loading is by text transform, not by framework: the file is wrapped in one
 * async function (its top-level `return` becomes that function's result) and
 * each `.ask<T>` call site is annotated with the schema parsed from the
 * workflow's own type text, because TypeScript erases type arguments at
 * runtime. Nothing about the format is hard-coded beyond the API surface — a
 * file that sticks to the surface runs as-is, with or without a metadata
 * header.
 *
 * Every model call an agent makes goes through the router's own
 * /v1/chat/completions, so a workflow run is metered in the same usage ledger
 * as every other request the router serves, and inherits its failover.
