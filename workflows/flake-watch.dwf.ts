description: "Flake watch as a batch loop: the probe-outcomes table every
  `npm test` appends to is scored by dev-decisions' history-gate, and the
  loop reports each suite's run count, flake probability, and a
  chase-or-quarantine verdict — naming, for any suite that both failed
  recently and scores as a high-probability flake, that it is the likely
  known flake: quarantine, don't chase. Report-only by design — quarantine
  is an owner decision, because it changes what green means for every future
  run, so v1 never escalates, never edits CI, never silences anything.
  Deterministic tool-flow: no agents, no asks, no model calls. Fails open by
  name: no table or a refusing scorer ends the loop with the refusal
  verbatim and every suite chased exactly as today."
whenToUse: After probe runs or on a schedule, when the question is which
  suites are flaky rather than broken. Run with `--grant tabular`. The loop
  only reads — `npm test` (through run-probes) is what grows the table.

/**
 * flake-watch: the outcomes table the kit already produces, scored.
 *
 * Batch-only by the tabular lane's law — history-gate's per-suite flake
 * scoring runs inside the dev-decisions CLI between agent rounds, and this
 * loop spawns no agents at all. The fail-open law is the moli law: a machine
 * without dev-decisions is a configured absence, so the not-ok branch ends
 * the loop with the refusal's own words and the standing behavior — every
 * suite chased exactly as today.
 *
 * v1 is report-only on purpose. Quarantine moves a suite out of the default
 * gate, which redefines "green" for everyone downstream — a call the loop
 * has no mandate to make, so it does not escalate it either. The report
 * names the likely known flake; the owner decides what happens to it. A
 * later wave may let review-sweep consume this table; this file stays a
 * read of it.
