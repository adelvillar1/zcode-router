description: "The media lane's narration seam, as a one-pass batch loop: render a
  request file of lines through gen1's speak legs, assemble the hyperframes
  `audio_meta.json` from the engine's own accountable rows, and gate the result
  against the script through the ASR round-trip. Verify mode is the default —
  a `--script`/`--audio` pair or an existing `--request`/`--meta`/`--project`
  render is gated with nothing rendered. Render mode speaks each line into
  `outDir` and gates the seam it just built. The verdict is advisory by the
  lane's law: `gaps` reports and escalates once, and the loop never blocks,
  because the engine's gate never blocks. A `--project` path-escape is the
  engine's refusal by name — the loop resolves nothing itself and passes the
  refusal through verbatim. Fails open by name: no dev-decisions, an unreadable
  request, or a refusing leg ends the loop with the refusal verbatim and
  nothing rendered."
whenToUse: Before or after rendering narration, when the question is whether the
  spoken audio still says what the script says. Run with `--grant media`.
  Hand-launched by design — the args are structured, and a render spends real
  provider seconds, so nothing here is router-assignable.
args:
  script:
    type: string
    description: Ground-truth script text (verify mode, single-file). Pair with `audio`.
    required: false
  audio:
    type: string
    description: Rendered audio file to verify against `script` (verify mode, single-file).
    required: false
  request:
    type: string
    description: Request file of lines (a JSON array of {id, text}, or an object with a "lines" array). With `meta` it is an existing render to verify; without it, render mode speaks these lines.
    required: false
  meta:
    type: string
    description: An existing audio_meta.json — its presence puts the loop in verify-seam mode against the render already on disk.
    required: false
  project:
    type: string
    description: Render project dir the meta's audio paths resolve against (default "." — the workspace root; the loop's own meta paths are workspace-relative).
    required: false
  outDir:
    type: string
    description: Where renders land and the loop's own audio_request.json / audio_meta.json are written (default assets/voice). Project-relative: a path outside the workspace is the engine's path-escape refusal, by name.
    required: false
  voice:
    type: string
    description: Voice id forwarded to every speak leg (default the provider catalog's own).
    required: false
  language:
    type: string
    description: Language forwarded to the speak legs and the ASR gate (default en).
    required: false
  speed:
    type: number
    description: Speech rate multiplier forwarded to the speak legs (default the provider's own).
    required: false
  format:
    type: string
    description: Audio format the render is named for and forwarded to the speak legs (default mp3). Every provider serves its own container and the row says which — a disagreement is named, never hidden.
    required: false
  dryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: Verify without rendering: no speak leg is called and no meta is written; the gate still runs against whatever seam is already on disk.
    required: false

/**
 * narrate: the seam's two halves, held together by the engine's own rows.
 *
 * Batch-only by the media lane's law — every leg here is a dev-decisions verb
 * between agent rounds, and this loop spawns no agents at all. It composes the
 * hyperframes seam from the engine's accountable rows rather than shelling
 * gen1's own route under the process grant: the rows are the accountability
 * surface (duration measured from the returned bytes, the provider leg that
 * answered, the request id), and one grant is one thing to police.
 *
 * The advisory law is the engine's, inherited unchanged: media-gate returns
 * WARN on gaps and ERROR when nothing could be verified, and it can never
 * block — the verdict rides an uncalibrated ASR until record-asr earns floors.
 * So this loop reports `gaps`, escalates once, and returns a normal result.
 * There is no blocking branch to take.
 *
 * The path-escape law is the engine's too: a meta whose voice path leaves the
 * project is refused by name inside the gate's row, and the loop passes that
 * sentence through verbatim. It resolves nothing itself.
