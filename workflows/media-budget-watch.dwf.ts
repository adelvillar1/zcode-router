description: "Media spend watched as a batch loop: gen1's telemetry sink is
  ingested into the tabular lane's media-seconds table (occurrence-keyed, so a
  re-run lands nothing twice), and the next day's audio-seconds are forecast
  per provider through sdm1 against a named budget. A provider with fewer than
  four recorded days degrades to recorded stats with the reason named — never
  a fabricated band — and degradation never escalates: a named reason is
  information, not a crossing. An estimate over the budget is reported and
  escalated exactly once. Report-only by law: the loop writes nothing of its
  own — the ingest verb owns its table — and it reads no file, so the
  forecast is the engine's row, never the loop's arithmetic. Fails open by
  name: no dev-decisions, no telemetry sink, or an empty table ends the loop
  with the refusal verbatim and the spend unjudged."
whenToUse: Daily after the render cadence, or before a batch of narration
  work, when the question is what the next day's media seconds cost and
  whether they fit the budget. Run with `--grant media`. The daily ingest is
  `npm run record:media`; this loop is the reading of what that cadence lands.

/**
 * media-budget-watch: the media-seconds table, forecast and judged.
 *
 * Batch-only by the media lane's law — record-media-runs and media-budget both
 * run inside the dev-decisions CLI between agent rounds, and this loop spawns
 * no agents at all. Two steps, in the engine's own order: ingest first (the
 * table the forecast reads is the table the ingest just wrote), then forecast.
 *
 * The report-only law is the lane's own and it has a wrinkle worth stating
 * plainly: this loop's first step DOES write — through the engine's ingest
 * verb, which owns its table and is accountable for every row it lands. The
 * loop itself writes nothing: no file, no config, no arithmetic of its own
 * over the engine's numbers. When a caller names a `scope`, the loop filters
 * the view and says so; it never recomputes the estimate, because the row
 * does not carry the per-provider values a scoped estimate would need — a
 * number the loop could not derive honestly is a number it does not print.
 *
 * The escalation law: `over` is a crossing and escalates once; `degraded` is
 * information and never escalates. The loop's fail-open law is the moli law —
 * no CLI, no sink, or an empty table ends the loop with the refusal's own
 * words and the spend unjudged.
