description: "The visual drift pre-filter, in shadow: a rendered wave's PNGs
  are embedded into a named corpus (dev-decisions' st-worker image leg —
  deterministic re-encode, so an unchanged render re-embeds at exactly 1.0000
  cosine), and each render is compared against the last-accepted baseline. A
  1.0000 match is logged as would-skip — the visual-judge dispatch a future
  wave could skip — and everything else is logged as dispatch-needed. SHADOW
  LAW: this loop skips nothing and dispatches nothing; it counts, and its
  counts are the promotion evidence. The one flip it owns is the baseline:
  with promote (or the owner's escalation answer) the wave's renders become
  the next baseline. Fails open by name."
whenToUse: After a visual deliverable wave, when the question is how much
  judge spend an unchanged re-render would have cost. Run with `--grant
  semantic`. The loop never touches the visual judge — it reads geometry and
  counts.

/**
 * render-watch: the watchdog law ("no-change runs spend nothing") extended to
 * pixels — in shadow. The comparison is deterministic on the embedding side
 * (the re-encode is proven 1.0000-stable), so a 1.0000 match means
 * "provably the same pixels", which is a hash-like property, not a similarity
 * judgment; everything below 1.0 is a lead. Skipping visual-judge dispatches
 * is a LATER wave's decision, earned by this loop's shadow counts — the code
 * here contains no skip and no dispatch, only counts, and the probe holds
 * that line (grep + execution).
