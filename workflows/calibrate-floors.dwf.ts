description: "Floor calibration as a batch loop: dev-decisions' override-prior
  scores the kit's shared calibration store — the judge and swarm gates
  already feed it — into per-head override probabilities, and the loop
  renders each head's suggested confidence floor beside the roster's static
  ones (0.6 for agent asks, 0.4 for workflow escalations) as an artifact. It
  then asks the owner one question — apply these floors? — and does nothing
  else: v1 proposes and never writes, because learned floors crossing into
  the roster is the owner's `kit apply`, not a loop's. Deterministic
  tool-flow: no agents, no asks, no model calls. Fails open by name: no
  store to read or a refusing scorer ends the loop with the refusal verbatim
  and the static floors standing unchanged."
whenToUse: After enough judged runs have accrued in the calibration store,
  when the question is whether the roster's static confidence floors still
  fit. Run with `--grant tabular`. The loop has no roster write path — the
  proposal is the owner's to apply by editing the roster and running
  `kit apply`.

/**
 * calibrate-floors: the calibration store the kit already feeds, scored.
 *
 * Batch-only by the tabular lane's law — override-prior runs inside the
 * dev-decisions CLI between agent rounds, and this loop spawns no agents at
 * all. The fail-open law is the moli law: a machine without dev-decisions is
 * a configured absence, so the not-ok branch ends the loop with the
 * refusal's own words and the static floors standing unchanged.
 *
 * The one-way rule of the wave: v1 proposes, never writes. The loop renders
 * the proposal, escalates it, and stops — the roster's thresholds change
 * only through the owner's own apply path. The plan's C5 test greps this
 * file for the marker below, so it lives as its own line.
