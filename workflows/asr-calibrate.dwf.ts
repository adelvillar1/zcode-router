description: "The media lane's promotion engine, as a batch loop: the pinned
  ASR fixture is round-tripped through the live gen1 legs into the shared
  feedback store (task `asr_roundtrip`, head `asr_faithful` — the join key
  calibration already reads), and every provider leg's accuracy and mean
  token agreement are graded against a named floor and a minimum row count. A
  leg that clears both is promotion evidence: the loop names it, escalates once
  that these legs are calibrated, and stops — lifting the `gen1_raw` eval-only
  tag is the owner's call, exactly as applying floors is theirs. Report-only by
  law: the loop reads the graded rows the verb just printed, never re-opens the
  feedback store, and has no write path to the engine's config or the tag.
  Fails open by name: no dev-decisions, a refusing leg, or every fixture
  refused ends the loop with the refusal verbatim and the tag standing."
whenToUse: On a schedule or before trusting any gen1-rendered narration, when
  the question is which ASR legs are accurate enough to promote out of
  eval-only. Run with `--grant media`. The loop produces evidence only — the
  promotion is the owner's.

/**
 * asr-calibrate: the pinned fixture, graded per leg, and nothing else.
 *
 * Batch-only by the media lane's law — record-asr makes wire calls to the ASR
 * legs between agent rounds, and this loop spawns no agents at all. The
 * report-only law is calibrate-floors' own: the loop's product is evidence (a
 * per-leg table, an artifact, one escalation), never a promotion. The
 * `gen1_raw` tag lifts by the owner's hand, and the loop's own text says so —
 * the plan's C2 test greps this file for the marker below, so it lives as its
 * own line.
 *
 * The fail-open law is the moli law: a machine without dev-decisions is a
 * configured absence, a leg without keys refuses by name, and a fixture dir
 * with no pairs refuses by name — every one of those ends the loop with the
 * refusal's own words and the tag standing unchanged.
