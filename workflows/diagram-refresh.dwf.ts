description: "The archify diagrams kept anchored to the code. Every source
  ref in a *.candidate.json pins a path and a line range at a revision; this
  loop audits those pins against the revision they name — byte identity over
  the whole pinned range, never label similarity — and re-pins the refs whose
  anchored bytes merely moved, finalizes the candidates it touched through
  the archify CLI (receipts moved back beside the candidate, a fresh
  refresh-<n> per round), and renders the stills. That is the mechanical
  four-fifths of the refresh procedure, executed and re-runnable. The
  judgment fifth is not in this file: what a wave's new node should say,
  whether a claim whose bytes changed is still true, and whether the still
  looks right are an agent's and a reader's. Fails open by name — no git, no
  candidates, an absent archify CLI, a refused layout each end the loop with
  the refusal verbatim and the diagrams exactly as they were authored."
whenToUse: After a code wave, before the diagrams are believed — or on a
  schedule, as the freshness row `kit doctor` already computes. Run with
  `--grant diagram,process` (process covers the stills leg only). The loop
  never authors a node, never verifies a claim's meaning, never repairs a
  rejected layout, and never looks at the PNGs.

/**
 * diagram-refresh: the mechanical four-fifths of the archify refresh, run as
 * a workflow.
 *
 * The identity rule is the whole engine here: a ref is intact when the bytes
 * at its pinned [line..end_line] equal the bytes at that range in the
 * revision the candidate pins. Nothing about the label is compared, because
 * fifteen of the repo's sixty-one labels are paraphrases ("run route", "judge
 * spec") that match nothing verbatim in the code they anchor — a label matcher
 * would bury real drift under its own noise. A ref whose bytes moved verbatim
 * elsewhere in the file is arithmetic to re-pin; a ref whose bytes were edited
 * is a claim that may now be false, and editing it is a judgment this loop
 * does not make — it is named, with its label and its old range, in the
 * artifact's to-do list.
 *
 * The fail-open law is moli's and dev-decisions': every not-ok branch ends
 * the loop with the refusal's own words and the standing behavior — the
 * diagrams stay as they were authored, and whoever asked hears why.
 *
 * Batch-only by construction: the loop spawns no agents and makes no model
 * calls. It is the audit/repin/finalize surface plus two process legs (the
 * candidate writer and render-png.mjs), and a report.
