description: "Quota forecast as a batch loop: the kit's own spend table —
  quota-spend.csv, written by `npm run record:quota` — is scored by
  dev-decisions' budget-gate (an sdm1 quantile band over each plan's weighted
  spend series), and the loop renders each plan's forecast band and
  exhaustion estimate beside the table's own freshness. A plan whose earliest
  band edge lands inside the horizon escalates — the ladder exists so an
  owner answer can re-route tiers before anything dies. Deterministic
  tool-flow throughout: no agents, no asks, no model calls; the one blocking
  judgment is the owner's. Fails open by name: no table, no dev-decisions,
  or an empty answer ends the loop with the refusal verbatim and routing
  unchanged."
whenToUse: Between sessions or on a schedule, when the question is which
  token plans are burning toward exhaustion inside the horizon. Run with
  `--grant tabular`. The loop only reads — `npm run record:quota` is what
  refreshes the table it reads.
args:
  plan:
    type: string
    description: One plan (providerId) to forecast — omit to forecast every plan the spend table declares.
    required: false
  horizonHours:
    type: number
    description: The forecast window in hours (default 72) — a plan whose earliest exhaustion estimate lands inside it escalates.
    required: false

/**
 * quota-forecast: the spend table the kit already produces, scored.
 *
 * Batch-only by the tabular lane's law — the sdm1 forecast runs inside the
 * dev-decisions CLI between agent rounds, never inside an ask, and this loop
 * spawns no agents at all. The fail-open law is the moli law: a machine
 * without dev-decisions is a configured absence, so every not-ok branch ends
 * the loop with the refusal's own words and "routing unchanged" — the kit
 * proceeds exactly as today.
 *
 * ASSUMPTION (noted per the plan): budget-gate is called with `--group
 * providerId` to split the series per plan, plus `--metric weightedSpend`
 * and `--horizon <h>` as the plan names them. The dev-decisions flag surface
 * is not verifiable from this repo; a wrong flag comes back as a tabular
 * not-ok carrying the CLI's own words, and the loop fails open with those
 * words verbatim rather than guessing twice.
