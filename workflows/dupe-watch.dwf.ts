description: "Calibration-store hygiene as a batch loop: dev-decisions'
  semantic lane indexes what each graded row still references (plan files,
  claims, notes — the stores are redacted, so the index is over surrogate
  text) and reports near-dupe pairs joined against the feedback store. Pairs
  whose two sides carry divergent grades escalate — that is an ambivalence in
  the calibration moat an owner must see; pairs with agreeing grades render a
  merge proposal; ungraded pairs are leads. Report-only by law: nothing
  merges, nothing annotates, rows stay eval-only (embeddings propose,
  sys1/sdm1 dispose). Fails open by name: no dev-decisions, no sem1, or no
  index ends the loop with the refusal verbatim and calibration unchanged."
whenToUse: On a schedule or after calibration-heavy sessions, when the
  question is which graded inputs are near-duplicates of each other and
  whether their grades agree. Run with `--grant semantic`. The loop only
  reads and rebuilds the eval-only index — it never writes the stores.

/**
 * dupe-watch: the exact-input_sha256 moat, given a neighborhood join.
 *
 * Batch-only by the semantic lane's law — every call here runs between agent
 * rounds, and this loop spawns no agents at all. Report-only by the lane's
 * own rule: a similarity score is a lead to confirm, never a verdict, so the
 * loop's outputs are an escalation (owner judgment), a proposal artifact, and
 * nothing else. The near-dupe signal is over SURROGATE text — what each
 * redacted row still references — so every pair here is a lead, and the
 * report says so. Fail-open law: every not-ok branch ends the loop with the
 * refusal's own words and "calibration unchanged".
